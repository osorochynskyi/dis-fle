#' Censor evenements table
#'
#' Replace all events after `date` by `"STATE2_PDV"` at `date`, and if there
#' are no other events before `date` add  `"STATE2_NO_PATHOL1"`.
#'
#' This function is used to censor data at 2012-12-31, but the method is
#' different from censoring applied by MichaÃ«l. For some reason, when there is
#' only a `"STATE2_NO_PATHOL1"` after `date` it is left as is. Whereas here
#' I chose to treat `"STATE2_NO_PATHOL1"` as any other event and censor it at
#' `date`, adding PDV and NO_PATHOL events. I justify this by thinking that this
#' individual was still exposed, even though we did not observe an event.
#' Perhaps this was done to avoid adding a ficticious "NO_PATHOL1".
#'
#' @param events data.frame with `id`, `date_event`, `event` columns
#' @param date date of censorship
#' @return censored `events` data.frame

#' Shift birthdays such that all first events are beyod the age of 50

#' excluded. This function shifts birthdays so that all events start at least
#' at the 50h birthday, plus some random quantity. This random quantity is a

#' look of the noise applied.

#' @return A `data.frame` with columns `id`, and `date_naissance` with adjusted
